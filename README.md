# dotfiles

Dotfiles I use.

## .zshrc

![Prompt screenshot](https://github.com/sam-cross/dotfiles/raw/master/Screenshot%202022-05-12%20at%2011.11.48.png)

Includes common emacs-style bindings including Ctrl+< to go back 1 word, and Ctrl+Backspace to delete the previous word.

`$` is also aliased to `sudo`, eg: `$ whoami`

### Quick Copy

`curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transiient/dotfiles/master/.zshrc" -o ~/.zshrc`

## Ideas?
